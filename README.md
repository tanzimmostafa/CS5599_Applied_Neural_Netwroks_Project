# CS5599_Applied_Neural_Netwroks_Project

This is a project for my CS5599: "Applied Neural Netwroks" graduate level course at Idaho State University.

This research explores chest X-ray diagnosis, employing CNNs (Xception, InceptionResnetV2, EfficientnetV2B1, Densenet169) across three datasets. The final
dataset is a combination of the first two datasets, comprising five distinct classes: Tuberculosis, COVID-19, Lung Opacity (Non-Covid Lung Infection), Viral Pneumonia, and Normal. I was able to achieve exceptional accuracy (>90%) using transfer learning and data augmentation, contributing valuable insights to enhance respiratory disease prediction in medical imaging.
